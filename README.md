This is my first project in HTML/CSS/Javascript.

When learning these languages I was introduced and inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's website where she makes 180 websites in 180 days. This particular project comes from by Day 7: Technicolor Boxes.

I'd like to continue developing this project by adding more effects, animations, and colors.
